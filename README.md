Mainboard: 
Raspberry Pi 4 <link>

Power supply: 
Stripped down  Xiaomi Mi BHR5121GL 20000 mAh <link>
Note: I have chosen this power supply as I have found it rather cheap (~30 EUR). It has 2 x 10000 mAh modules, 2 x USB-A ports and 1 x USB-C ports. From my testing, all ports can power the Pi. Should you want a different power supply unit for the cyberdeck, any external battery should work, as long as it outputs 5V 3A.

Display: 
Repurposed 7 inch 50 pin screen from an old tablet + adaptor board <link> 

Keyboard + Mouse:

Miscellaneous:
