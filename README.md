**Cyberdeck V1**

Over the past few months I have been working on a design for a cyberdeck based on the Pi4 board. All of the components are off the shelf and easily accessible. 

One of the advantages of this design is that it allows access to the GPIO pins, thus facilitating the integration of external sensors/boards.

This is the outcome of said project. 

**Mainboard**:   
Raspberry Pi 4B 4GB RAM [link](https://www.tme.eu/ro/details/sc0194-9/raspberry-pi-mini-calculatoare/raspberry-pi/raspberry-pi-4-model-b-4gb-ram)

**Power supply**:   
Stripped down Xiaomi Mi BHR5121GL 20000 mAh [link](https://www.mi.com/global/product/mi-50w-power-bank-20000)

Note:   
I have chosen this power supply as I have found it rather cheap (\~30 EUR). It has 2 x 10000 mAh modules, 2 x USB-A ports and 1 x USB-C ports. From my testing, all ports can power the Pi. Should you want a different power supply unit for the cyberdeck, any external battery should work, as long as it outputs 5V 3A. Additionally, the USB-A outport can be used to power other devices.

To save on space and weight I have removed the outer enclosure.

**Display**:
